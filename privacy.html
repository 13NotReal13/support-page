    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Last updated: June 20, 2024</p>
<p>This privacy policy outlines what personal data is collected in the My Calories 24/7 app, how this data is used, and what external links are provided.</p>

<h3>Collected Data</h3>
<p>In the <em>My Calories 24/7</em> app, you can enter your date of birth, weight, height, and gender. This data is used for calculating calories and is not transmitted to external servers. All data is stored locally on your device.</p>

<h3>Using the Camera for Barcode Scanning</h3>
<p>Access to your device's camera is required to activate the barcode scanning feature in the <em>My Calories 24/7</em> app. This function is used for reading product information and does not involve transferring images or videos to external servers. All data is processed locally on your device.</p>
<p>Using the camera requires your explicit consent, which is requested upon first use of the function. You can withdraw this consent at any time by changing the camera access settings on your device.</p>

<h3>Integration with World Open Food Facts</h3>
<p>To provide product information, our app uses the World Open Food Facts API, accessed via product barcodes. This feature allows us to obtain up-to-date information about the composition, nutritional value, and other aspects of products. Transmitted data is limited exclusively to product barcodes and does not include users' personal information.</p>
<p>Product data is provided by <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">World Open Food Facts</a> and is available under the Open Database License (ODbL). You can review the privacy policy of World Open Food Facts <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use">here</a>.</p>
<p>We use a custom User-Agent to identify our app when making API requests.</p>

<h3>Use of Data</h3>
<p>Entered data is used exclusively for the app's functionality, to provide personalized calorie counting recommendations. For enhanced information, a link to an external resource: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate">Basal Metabolic Rate</a> is provided.</p>

<h3>Advertising and Subscriptions</h3>
<p>The app displays advertisements that may use anonymous data about your device to deliver relevant ads. You will be asked to consent to personalized advertising on your first use of the app, which allows for ads that are more relevant to your interests. You may opt out of such tracking at any time in the app settings. However, consenting to personalized advertising is recommended for a better user experience and to support our app.</p>
<p>The app also offers paid subscriptions that allow ads to be disabled and access to additional features. Subscription details, including cost and terms, are available within the app. The subscription provides full access to functionality without ads and can be purchased through the standard payment mechanisms of your device.</p>

    <h3>Using Firebase Services</h3>
<p>Our app uses the following Google Firebase services to enhance functionality and ensure stability:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</strong>: We use FCM to send push notifications to users. FCM collects device tokens, which are used exclusively for delivering notifications. This data is not used to identify users and is not shared with third parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>: This service is used for monitoring app crashes and errors. Crashlytics collects information about the device type, operating system, and the circumstances under which the crash occurred, helping us to improve our app’s stability. This information is anonymized and not linked to any personal data of the users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these services helps us ensure high-quality app performance and enhances user convenience. Your data is processed confidentially and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<h3>User Rights</h3>
<p>Users have the right to review, modify, or delete their personal data at any time in the app settings. Additionally, users can opt out of using certain app features that require data entry.</p>

<h3>Rights to Access, Modify, and Delete Information</h3>
<p>Users can manage push notifications by subscribing or unsubscribing to them in their device settings at any time. This allows users to choose whether they want to receive notifications from us.</p>
<p>Furthermore, users can request access to any personal data we hold, as well as demand their correction or deletion. Your requests for managing personal information can be sent to our email address provided in the contact information.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer for External Links</h3>
